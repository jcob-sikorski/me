# Personal Website – Jakub Siekiera

This repository contains the source code for my personal website and portfolio.

The site showcases selected backend, cloud, and AI automation projects I’ve worked on, along with my technical focus, experience, and contact information. It is designed to be **minimal, fast, and content-first**, with an emphasis on real-world impact rather than buzzwords.

## 👋 About Me

I’m a **Backend Software Engineer specializing in Java & Spring Boot**, with experience building **cloud-native systems**, **AI-driven automation**, and **scalable backend architectures**.

My work spans:

* backend system design
* event-driven and asynchronous processing
* automation and AI integrations
* cloud deployment and CI/CD pipelines

I’m open to **backend engineering** and **consulting** roles.

## 🧩 What’s Included

### **Selected Work**

The site highlights real projects with:

* clear problem statements
* technology stacks
* concrete contributions
* measurable business impact

Projects include:

* AI-powered SEO automation platforms
* high-scale AI video rendering systems
* real-time messaging backends

### **Technical Focus**

My current focus areas reflected on the site:

* **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot, REST APIs, SQL
* **Architecture:** event-driven systems, scalable backend design
* **Cloud & DevOps:** AWS, Docker, CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)

## 🛠 Tech Stack (Website)

The website itself is intentionally simple:

* **React**
* **React Router**
* **Tailwind CSS**
* **Lucide Icons**

No backend is required for the site — it’s a static frontend focused on clarity and readability.

## 🚀 Running Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jcob-sikorski/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in the console).

## 📄 CV & Links

The website includes direct links to:

* GitHub
* LinkedIn
* CV (PDF)
* Writing section
* Email contact

All links are kept intentionally visible and easy to access.

## 🎯 Philosophy

This site is not meant to be flashy.

It’s meant to answer, quickly and clearly:

* *What problems has this engineer solved?*
* *What systems can they design and build?*
* *What impact have they delivered?*
